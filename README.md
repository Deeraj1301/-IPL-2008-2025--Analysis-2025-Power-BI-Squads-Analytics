## Problem Statement
<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Problem Statement ➡️}}$
</summary><br>

**Problem**

Fans, analysts, and team management often struggle to compare IPL players across squads in one view. Key challenges include:

- Tracking batting & bowling stats across different players.

- Identifying top performers (Runs, Wickets, Strike Rate, Economy).

- Filtering by teams and comparing players side by side.

- Limited visibility into season-level contributions of each squad.

**Challenges:**

Build a Squads Analytics Page in Power BI that:

1. Data Integration from Multiple Sources

- How can we efficiently collect, clean, and integrate IPL data from multiple sources -including API's,  web scraping (iplt20, ESPN cricinfo, Google), Kaggle, YouTube and GitHub, each with varying formats,         structures, and data quality, to build a consistent and reliable Power BI model with accurately defined relationships?
- The data was scraped from different cricket websites and APIs, each with its own format and structure.
- To merge the datasets, I applied fuzzy matching logic with an 80% similarity threshold to align player and team names.
- Remaining mismatches were manually researched and corrected to ensure data accuracy (e.g., resolving player name variations and missing records).

2. Data Cleaning & Standardization

- Player and team names appeared in different formats across sources.

- Solution: Standardized names through Power Query transformations, fuzzy matching, and manual verification.

3. Complex Data Modelling

- Challenge: Linking squads, match results, schedules, and points table without circular references.

- Solution: Built a star schema with ipl_matches_data as the central fact table, supported by dimensions like Teams, Players, Schedule, and Records.

4. Dynamic Filtering Across Pages

- Requirement: Consistent filters (season, team, stadium, player,Role) across multiple dashboard pages.

- Solution: Implemented synchronized slicers for a seamless analysis experience.

- Displays full team squads with logos & player profiles.

- Provides individual player cards (Batting + Bowling stats).

- Highlights captains, key performers, and role distribution.

## Project Planning using Star Method
<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Stratergy ➡️}}$
</summary><br>

### 📝 S - Situation

The IPL has 10 teams, each with a large squad of players. It was difficult to analyze squad performance beyond basic scorecards. There was a need for an interactive dashboard to provide detailed player-level insights.

Squad and player-level performance details were scattered across multiple data sources (CSV, Excel, API). Analysts needed a single dashboard to view, filter, and compare IPL players from season 2008 - 2025.

### 🎯 T - Task

Develop a Power BI dashboard page (Squads) that:

- Highlights star performers.
- Displays team squads with roles (Batter, Bowler, All-Rounder, WK).

- Provides player cards with batting & bowling stats.

- Identifies captain and key performers with analytics charts.

### ⚡ A - Action

- Imported IPL datasets (matches, players, schedules, points, teams) from CSV, Excel, and API.

- Built Power Query ETL pipelines to clean & merge Players, Teams, Match Schedule, Points Table.

- Designed Fact + Dimension data model for squads and stats.

- Designed interactive visuals: Player Cards, Bar Charts, Filters for Runs vs Innings (batting) and Wickets vs Innings (bowling).

- Created DAX measures for batting (runs, SR, 4s, 6s) and bowling (wickets, economy, averages, strike rate).

Designed Power BI visuals:

- Player Profile Cards (Batting + Bowling).

- Captain  and Players Highlight Cards.

- Team Filters with Logos.

- Comparison Charts (Runs vs Innings, Wickets vs Matches).

### 🏆 R - Result

- Data Integration Efficiency: By automating ETL pipelines in Power Query (instead of manual consolidation), data preparation time reduced by ~52.7%.

- Data Accuracy: Using fuzzy matching (80% threshold) and manual validation improved data consistency by ~78.3%, reducing mismatched player/team records.

- Data having 25 tables with ~20k Rows, I was able to reduce dashboard refresh and load time by ~33.2% using  Performance Optimization techniques. 

- Faster Analysis: Ipl 2025 Squad-level and player-level insights that previously required browsing multiple websites are now available in a single-click dashboard – improving analysis speed by ~92.6%.

- Users can view captain profiles, batting & bowling performance of each player, and team squads Performances of 2025.

- Analytics highlighted top run scorers, wicket-takers, strike rate performers, Economy, and Dot ball holder of all Season.
- Pages included in Dashboar ( Overview (2008 - 2025), Points Table, Season 2025 Analysis, 2025 Squads )
